CREATE TABLE bangalore_corporators (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  ward_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  ward_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  party VARCHAR(100),
  contact_number VARCHAR(20),
  email VARCHAR(255),

```

## Target: Start with BBMP Corporators

### Why BBMP First?
1. **Largest number**: 243 corporators - most direct impact on citizens
2. **Local issues**: Roads, garbage, water - daily problems
3. **Accountability gap**: Less scrutiny than MLAs/MPs
4. **Data available**: BBMP has official list
5. **Citizen engagement**: People know their ward councillor

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Create BBMP scraper** to fetch all 243 corporators
2. **Integrate MyNeta data** for detailed profiles
3. **Add to frontend** with ward-wise filtering
4. **Enable promises tracking** for local issues (road repair, streetlights, etc.)
5. **Community forum** for ward-level discussions
