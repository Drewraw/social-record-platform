# Gemini API Integration Guide

## Setup

1. Get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

2. Add it to your `.env` file:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Features

The Gemini AI integration provides the following capabilities:

### 1. Statement Analysis
Analyze political statements for clarity, feasibility, and potential impact.

```javascript
const { analyzeStatement } = require('./config/gemini');

const analysis = await analyzeStatement("We will build 5 new schools in 6 months");
console.log(analysis);
```

### 2. Promise Summarization
Generate summaries of an official's promises and performance.

```javascript
const { summarizePromises } = require('./config/gemini');

const promises = [
  { title: "Build 5 schools", status: "completed" },
  { title: "Fix roads", status: "in-progress" }
];

const summary = await summarizePromises(promises);
console.log(summary);
```

### 3. Compare Statement with Reality
Compare political statements with ground reality.

```javascript
const { compareWithReality } = require('./config/gemini');

const comparison = await compareWithReality(
  "24/7 water supply by December 2024",
  "Current average: 18 hours per day as of October 2025"
);
console.log(comparison);
```

## API Endpoints (Optional)

You can create API endpoints to use Gemini AI features:

### POST /api/officials/:id/analyze
Analyze an official's overall performance

### POST /api/promises/:id/analyze
Analyze a specific promise

### POST /api/compare/:id/ai-analysis
Get AI-powered comparison analysis

## Usage in Frontend

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

// Analyze a statement
const analyzePromise = async (promiseId) => {
  const response = await axios.post(`/api/promises/${promiseId}/analyze`);
  return response.data.analysis;
};
```

## Example Controller Implementation

```javascript
// controllers/aiController.js
const { analyzeStatement, summarizePromises } = require('../config/gemini');

exports.analyzeOfficial = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    
    // Fetch official's promises
    const promises = await getPromisesByOfficialId(id);
    
    // Generate AI summary
    const summary = await summarizePromises(promises);
    
    res.json({ summary });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to analyze official' });
  }
};
```

## Rate Limits

- Gemini API has rate limits
- Implement caching for frequent requests
- Store AI-generated insights in database

## Best Practices

1. **Cache Results**: Store AI analyses in the database to avoid repeated API calls
2. **Error Handling**: Always wrap Gemini calls in try-catch blocks
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling on your API
4. **User Feedback**: Show loading states when generating AI content
5. **Fallbacks**: Have default responses if AI service is unavailable
