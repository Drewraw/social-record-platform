# 🏷️ How We Use Labels

We use **labels** to organize issues and pull requests in the **Social Record Platform** project.  
Labels help everyone quickly understand what an issue is about, where it belongs, and who might handle it.

Before creating a new issue, please read our [Labels Guide](./LABELS.md).

| `bug` | When something is broken or not working correctly |

## 💡 Labeling Tips

| **Tip** | **Description** |
|----------|----------------|
| 🧩 **Choose one area label** | Tell us which part of the app your issue affects (`frontend`, `backend`, `docs`, etc.) |
| 🔖 **Add one type label** | Describe what kind of issue it is (`bug`, `enhancement`, `help-wanted`, etc.) |
| 🕵️ **Not sure?** | Just add `help-wanted` — maintainers will tag the rest. |
| 🧠 **New here?** | Look for issues with the label `good-first-issue` to start contributing. |
| 🧱 **Duplicate check** | Always check existing issues before creating a new one. |
