## 🪄 How Roles Work

1. Everyone starts as a **Contributor**.  
2. After consistent high-quality PRs and reviews → you may be invited as a **Reviewer**.  
3. Reviewers who maintain modules and participate in multiple releases → may be promoted to **Maintainer**.

---

## 🚀 Contribution Flow

1. Fork the repo and create a PR.  
2. Add the correct **labels** (see [LABELS.md](./LABELS.md)).  
3. Your PR automatically routes to the right **Reviewer** (based on [CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS)).  
4. After approval, **Maintainers** merge into the main branch.
