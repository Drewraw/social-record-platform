## 🪄 How Roles Work

1. Everyone starts as a **Contributor**.  
2. After consistent high-quality PRs and reviews → you may be invited as a **Reviewer**.  
3. Reviewers who maintain modules and participate in multiple releases → may be promoted to **Maintainer**.

---

## 🚀 Contribution Flow

1. Fork the repo and create a PR.  
2. Add the correct **labels** (see [LABELS.md](./LABELS.md)).  
3. Your PR automatically routes to the right **Reviewer** (based on [CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS)).  
4. After approval, **Maintainers** merge into the main branch.

> The team handles shown below (like `@frontend-team`, `@backend-team`) are **placeholders** for future contributor groups.  
> Currently, all modules are owned and reviewed by **@Drewraw** until new maintainers join.

Maintainers reserve the right to make final decisions on merges and releases, but everyone’s input is welcome.  
We’re building this platform **together** — one transparent, accountable contribution at a time. ✨
